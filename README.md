# Welcome to my project...
A small project for organizations where they can opt for a monthly request limit, and based on the limit they can access the request API. This project is the POC for the Subscription Handling using API Key.


## Database

This project is using Postgres, and below are the db details.

Tables:

```text
1. organizations

- organization_id       - primary key
- email                 - unique
- name
- time_stamp
```

```text
2. organization_subscriptions

- subscription_id       - primary key
- organization_id       - foreign key
- api_key               - unique
- subscription_plan
- monthly_limit
```

```text
3. requests

- request_id            - primary key
- organization_id       - foreign key
- time_stamp
```

Indexes:

```text
1. idx_organization_request_count - (organization_id, time_stamp)
```

Views:

```text
1. view_organization_subscription_details

- organization_id
- name
- email
- subscription_plan
- api_key
- monthly_limit
- time_stamp
```

## Engineering Design Decisions
1. Separated `organization` table and `organization_subscriptions` table. As we may need to change subscription details. To maintain the safety.
2. Created `view` to remove the redundancy of using the same join and the same information everywhere.
3. We could have used `Materialized Views` for the `monthly request count` as a caching. But we need to refresh the view periodically to maintain consistency.
4. Middleware is used to handle the `monthly limit` so we can reuse the functionality.
5. In middleware I have attached `organization data` to the request object so we can use it in any controller later. 
6. `apiKeyActual` is generated and hashed using *bcrypt*. The `apiKeyHashed` is stored in the database.
   Then `userApiKey` is generated by _*appending organizationID to apiKeyActual*_, and given to the user.
   When a user sends userApiKey we again extract *apiKeyActual* and *organizationID* from the same and check for correctness.
   In middleware, they get organization details with *apiKeyHashed* and validate the key.
   This flow ensures the apiKeys stored in the database differ from those given to the user. So no one can recreate the same key.
7. Used `row level lock` for managing the concurrency in the project as multiple read, inserts may cause problems.
8. Created index on the `requests` table for efficiently getting the `monthly request count`.
   You can see the difference in the costs of the same query using `EXPLAIN ANALYSE`.

    * Query without index:
    ```sql
    -- change index settings to OFF
    SET enable_indexscan = OFF;
    SET enable_bitmapscan = OFF;
    SET enable_indexonlyscan = OFF;

    -- execute query
    EXPLAIN ANALYSE
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM requests
    WHERE
        organization_id = 1 AND
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM time_stamp) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM NOW());
    ```
    
    * Query Execution Explanation & Analysis:
    ```text
    Aggregate (cost=51.63..51.64 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.015..0.016 rows=1 loops=1)
      -> Seq Scan on requests (cost=0.00..51.62 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=0.010..0.012 rows=2 loops=1)
            Filter: ((organization_id = 1) AND (EXTRACT(month FROM time_stamp) = EXTRACT(month FROM NOW())))
    Planning Time: 0.118 ms
    Execution Time: 0.034 ms

    ```

     * Query with index:
    ```sql
    -- change index settings to ON
    SET enable_indexscan = ON;
    SET enable_bitmapscan = ON;
    SET enable_indexonlyscan = ON;

    -- execute query
    EXPLAIN ANALYSE
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM requests
    WHERE
        organization_id = 1 AND
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM time_stamp) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM NOW());
    ```

    * Query Execution Explanation & Analysis:
    ```text
    Aggregate (cost=14.86..14.87 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.021..0.021 rows=1 loops=1)
      -> Bitmap Heap Scan on requests (cost=4.22..14.85 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=0.017..0.017 rows=2 loops=1)
            Recheck Cond: (organization_id = 1)
            Filter: (EXTRACT(month FROM time_stamp) = EXTRACT(month FROM NOW()))
            Heap Blocks: exact=1
            -> Bitmap Index Scan on idx_organization_request_count (cost=0.00..4.22 rows=9 width=0) (actual time=0.009..0.009 rows=2 loops=1)
                Index Cond: (organization_id = 1)
    Planning Time: 0.092 ms
    Execution Time: 0.041 ms
    ```

* _**Conclusion**_: The cost of the `query without index` is much higher than the cost of the `query with index`. So, it's better to use index queries.


## Features
- _Register organization_
- _Admin dashboard_: admin can see all organization details.
- _Organization details_: this api has a monthly limit.


## Useful commands

The project makes use of node and its package manager to help you out carrying some common tasks such as running a project.

### Install dependencies

```console
$ yarn
```

### Run the application

Run the application which will be listening on port `8080`. There are two ways to run the application.

- Run the application with the current code

  ```console
  $ yarn start
  ```

- Run the application with reload on save

  ```console
  $ yarn dev
  ```

## TODO's
Below are some of the points we can consider for improving **Reliability**, and **Scalability** of the existing system.

- Need to implement the _isAdmin_ check using middleware for _Authorization_ purposes.
- While generating _apiKey_ we can use _subdomain_ instead of _organizationID_.
- The use of **In-Memory Cache** can speed up the request handling transactions.
- We can leverage **Asynchronous Architecture** for tasks like _Register Organization_ and _API Key Generation_ as it can afford delay.
- We can add more features like.. **Payments, Subscriptions, and Notifications**.



## Thank you!! Happy Coding!!
